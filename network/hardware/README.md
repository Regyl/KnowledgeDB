# Hub
Hub is a device that allows to connect many devices to each
other at the same time. The biggest minus is generated noises during
transfer data.
# Switch
Switch is very similar to a hub, but with one difference - it's a
data link layer device (hub is physical layer device). It's reduce
the size of collision domains.
# Router
Is a network-layer device. They route traffic through independent networks.
## Domain collision
Network segment, where only one node can transmit data at the same time.  
It happens because data transmit to all network nodes, even if they shouldn't
accept it. If you try to send data from both edges of cable they just face
and make data unreadable.
# Cables
There are 2 types:
- Copper (consists of copper twisted pairs). In this type used line coding to understand where zeros on ones.
- Fiber (consists of glass strings) - more expensive and fragile
