# Introduction
***Encryption*** is a data transformation method, available for human reading,
into unavailable for understanding form.  
***Decryption*** as u may guess, is a reverse operation.

## Types
You may use one key for encryption and decryption (it's a symmetrical encrypt), 
or a pair of keys (asymmetrical), where the first named *private* and uses for decryption, 
and the second - *public* - uses for encryption.
1. Symmetrical
2. Asymmetrical

Despite all this, symmetrical keys are still used. 
In contrast to asymmetrical algorithms, they have bigger performance.  
For example, SSL/TLS uses *asymmetrical on handshake stage*, 
exchanges symmetrical key and further use only them.
