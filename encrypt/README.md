# Introduction
- ***Encryption*** is a data transformation method, available for human reading,
into unavailable for understanding form.  
- ***Decryption*** as u may guess, is a reverse operation.

2. [Type by encryption strength](#Type-[Strength])
3. [The best algorithms](#best-known)

## Type [Methods]
You may use one key for encryption and decryption (it's a symmetrical encrypt), 
or a pair of keys (asymmetrical), where the first named *private* and uses for decryption, 
and the second - *public* - uses for encryption.
1. ***Symmetrical***
2. ***Asymmetrical***

Despite all this, symmetrical keys are still used. 
In contrast to asymmetrical algorithms, they have bigger performance.  
For example, SSL/TLS uses *asymmetrical on handshake stage*, 
exchanges symmetrical key and further use only them.

## Type [Strength]
There are two types:
1. Absolutely strong
2. Enough strong

## Best known
1. Asymmetrical
   1. ECSDA - Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
   2. RSA - Rivest, Shamir Ð¸ Adelman
   3. DSA - Digital Signature Algorithm
   4. ElGamal encryption
2. Symmetrical
   1. AES - Advanced Encryption Standard
   2. DES - Data Encryption Standard

## Uses approaches
1. ***Avalanche effect*** -
2. Cipher
   1. ***Block cipher*** - symmetrical cipher, which operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks.
   2. ***Stream cipher*** - symmetrical cipher, which encrypts each byte (symbol) according to key and symbol place in text.
