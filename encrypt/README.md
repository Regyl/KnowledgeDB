# Introduction

into unavailable for understanding form.  
***Decryption*** as u may guess, is a reverse operation.

## Types
You may use one key for encryption and decryption (it's a symmetrical encrypt), 
or a pair of keys (asymmetrical), where the first named *private* and uses for decryption, 
and the second - *public* - uses for encryption.
